# s2ds-d3js
DataViz of S2DS 2016's course 

The deployed site is currently here: http://guhu.website/s2dsMap.html

Contributions are welcome to:
- Fix the data: connections and names need to be completed (in src/data/ .json)
- Improve the style (colors, shapes, etc)
- Improve the behaviour:
    - The image display is buggy, and ugly in the way is implemented (I have no idea what I am doing) 
    - Add text next to images
    - Add banner with Pivigo teams
    - Add info about companies

What's the quickest way to play with the code:

<li>Fork repo and clone it to your pc</li>
<li>Download MAMP</li> and point it to repo (it's a server on your pc, it allows you to run the website locally and see it in your browser)
<li>correct data in json</li>
<li>and/or play with the html</li>
